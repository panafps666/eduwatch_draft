            <h1>EduWatch - Faculty Attendance Monitoring System</h1>
            <p> This digital platform streamlines the management of faculty participation in academic events and
                institutional obligations by replacing inefficient paper-based tracking methods that often lead to
                incomplete records, administrative burden, and limited data analysis. Designed for faculty members,
                professors, lecturers, and academic staff, it supports accreditation requirements, ensures compliance
                with professional development mandates, and enables data-driven decision-making for resource allocation.
                By providing verifiable records of faculty involvement, the system enhances transparency in governance,
                aids in performance evaluations, promotion processes, and institutional accountability, while reducing
                manual administrative tasks. Additionally, its New Hire Registration feature simplifies onboarding by
                automatically creating user accounts, assigning role-based access permissions, and seamlessly
                integrating
                newly recruited personnel into the monitoring system.

            <p> This platform optimizes the management of faculty participation in academic events and institutional
                duties by replacing traditional paper-based methods that often result in incomplete records, heavy
                administrative work, and limited analytical insights. Tailored for professors, lecturers, and academic
                staff, it ensures compliance with accreditation standards and professional development requirements
                while enabling data-driven resource allocation. By maintaining verifiable participation records, it
                strengthens transparency, supports performance evaluations, promotions, and institutional
                accountability, all while minimizing manual workload. Its New Hire Registration feature further
                streamlines onboarding by automatically generating accounts, assigning appropriate role-based access,
                and
                integrating new faculty into the monitoring system with ease.
